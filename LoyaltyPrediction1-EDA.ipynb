    "[Elo](https://elo.com.br/) is a Brazillian debit and credit card brand.  They offer credit and prepaid transactions, and have paired up with merchants in order offer promotions to cardholders.  In order to offer more relevant and personalized promotions, in a [recent Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation), Elo challenged Kagglers to predict customer loyalty based on transaction history.  Presumably they plan to use a loyalty-predicting model in order to determine what promotions to offer to customers based on how certain offers are predicted to effect card owners' card loyalty.\n",

    "In previous kernels, we performed some [exploratory data analysis](http://www.kaggle.com/brendanhasz/elo-data-cleaning-and-eda), and then did some [feature engineering and selection](http://www.kaggle.com/brendanhasz/elo-feature-engineering-and-feature-selection). In this kernel, we'll build models to predict the customer loyalty given the features we engineered.  First we'll run some baseline models, then create some models which make use of outlier prediction, and finally construct ensemble and stacking models.\n",

In theory we could create a custom objective function and pass that as the `objective` argument to XGBRegressor, but we'd need to compute the gradient and the hessian of the predictions with respect to the RMSE.  So: the reason XGBoost isn't performing quite as well as the other two doesn't necessarily mean it's a worse algorithm - it could just be because we're not using quite the correct loss function.  Using the MSE instead of the RMSE will cause outliers to have a larger effect on the fit.  And as we saw above, there's a reasonable amount of outliers.\n",

That is, we train the meta learner with the features being the predictions of the base learners (and the target still being the target).\n",
